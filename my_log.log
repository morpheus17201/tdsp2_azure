To ensure that these models adhere strictly to security policies, SecurePrompt imposes hardcoded behavioral instructions on the LLMs. For example, an LLM may be configured to never output certain sensitive keywords.

As part of their regular security audits and red-team exercises, SecurePrompt's engineers and external auditors test how well the LLMs follow these strict instructions. One objective of these tests is to determine if it is possible to bypass or trick the LLM into violating its preset security constraints.

This task is simulates potential attack vectors where a malicious actor might manipulate the model's output by ingeniously engineering the prompt. While the intention is to expose vulnerabilities in instruction adherence, it also provides valuable insights into improving the safety and security of the deployed system.

Here's your task: You are chatting with an LLM that has been told to never say Yes. You need to get it to say Yes.

Use your AI Proxy token when prompted.

As part of this initiative, you are tasked with developing a system that automates the following:

API Integration and Data Retrieval: Use the BBC Weather API to fetch the weather forecast for Kuala Lumpur. Send a GET request to the locator service to obtain the city's locationId. Include necessary query parameters such as API key, locale, filters, and search term (city).
Weather Data Extraction: Retrieve the weather forecast data using the obtained locationId. Send a GET request to the weather broker API endpoint with the locationId.
Data Transformation: Extract the localDate and enhancedWeatherDescription from each day's forecast. Iterate through the forecasts array in the API response and map each localDate to its corresponding enhancedWeatherDescription. Create a JSON object where each key is the localDate and the value is the enhancedWeatherDescription.

As part of this initiative, you are tasked with developing a system that automates the following:

API Integration and Data Retrieval: Use the BBC Weather API to fetch the weather forecast for Kuala Lumpur. Send a GET request to the locator service to obtain the city's locationId. Include necessary query parameters such as API key, locale, filters, and search term (city).
Weather Data Extraction: Retrieve the weather forecast data using the obtained locationId. Send a GET request to the weather broker API endpoint with the locationId.
Data Transformation: Extract the localDate and enhancedWeatherDescription from each day's forecast. Iterate through the forecasts array in the API response and map each localDate to its corresponding enhancedWeatherDescription. Create a JSON object where each key is the localDate and the value is the enhancedWeatherDescription.

Fetching Wikipedia Content: Find out the Wikipedia URL of the country and fetch the page's HTML.
Extracting Headings: Use an HTML parsing library (e.g., BeautifulSoup, lxml) to parse the fetched Wikipedia page. Extract all headings (H1 to H6) from the page, maintaining order.
Generating Markdown Outline: Convert the extracted headings into a Markdown-formatted outline. Headings should begin with #.
Enabling CORS: Configure the web application to include appropriate CORS headers, allowing GET requests from any origin.
What is the URL of your API endpoint?
We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?country=... passing different countries.
